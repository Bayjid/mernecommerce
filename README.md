# E-commerce Website (MERN Stack)

 I built an eCommerce website using Stripe as a payment method and the Cloudinary API for 
 image uploading and display. The user can create an account, search for products, add items 
 to the cart, confirm the order, pay with a debit or credit card, and write reviews of the 
 products. Using the admin panel, admins can add, update, and delete products. The admin can 
 also cancel orders.
